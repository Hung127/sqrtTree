# Square Root Tree Project

## Project Description

The Square Root Tree project implements a data structure known as a square root tree (SqrtTree), which is useful for range queries and updates on arrays with a time complexity better than naive approaches. This repository includes various implementations and supporting files to demonstrate the usage of SqrtTree alongside other related data structures like FenwickTree and SegmentTree.

## How to Install on GitHub

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Hung127/sqrtTree.git
    
    ```
    
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```
    cd sqrtTree
    
    ```
    

## How to Run the Project

1.  Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
2.  Compile the main.cpp file:
    
    ```
    g++ -o sqrtTree main.cpp
    
    ```
    
3.  Run the compiled executable:
    
    ```
    ./sqrtTree
    
    ```
